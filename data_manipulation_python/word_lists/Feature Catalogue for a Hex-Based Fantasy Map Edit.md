# Feature Catalogue for a Hex-Based Fantasy Map Editor

A successful hex editor must let creators paint broad strokes (dominant terrain) and drop evocative icons (settlements, ruins, lairs without losing cartographic clarity.  The list below distils the symbol sets found in classic Mystaran legends, OSR hex-crawl tools, Ordnance Survey practice and modern VTT icon packs into one comprehensive reference[^1][^2].  Treat each heading as a tool-palette group; together they cover the vast majority of requests from TTRPG cartographers.

## 1  Foundational Terrain Hexes

These fills form the background of every hex and normally carry no other icon.

* Plains and prairies – open, arable grassland suitable for farms or steppes[^3][^4].
* Savannas and dry brushland – warm-climate grassland with scattered trees[^5][^6].
* Deserts – sandy dunes, rocky desert, badlands and salt flats[^2][^6].
* Hills – gentle relief; offer separate fills for barren, grassy and forested hills[^1][^5].
* Mountains – rugged highlands; include snowy peaks and forested foothills[^1][^3].
* Volcanic land – active, dormant or dead cones plus basaltic badlands[^2][^7].
* Forest, woodland and jungle – light/heavy deciduous, evergreen, coniferous or tropical rainforest[^5][^3].
* Wetlands – swamp, marsh, bog or fen, each with distinct movement penalties[^2][^5].
* Tundra, steppe-tundra and frozen moor – treeless, permafrost terrain[^5][^8].
* Glacier / ice sheet / ice floe – solid ice masses or drifting floe hexes[^2][^5].
* Broken or blighted lands – badlands, wastelands, magically scorched zones[^6][^9].
* Shallow sea, deep ocean and abyssal trench – depth-coded water fills[^10][^11].
* Coral reef and kelp forest – specialised coastal seabed textures[^10][^12].


## 2  Hydrological Features

Water icons overlay or replace a normal terrain fill.

* Rivers, streams, creeks and brooks with branching sources and deltas[^13][^14].
* Lakes, ponds and reservoirs, including crater lakes and sacred pools[^15][^11].
* Waterfalls, rapids and cataracts for altitude breaks along rivers[^3][^1].
* Whirlpools or maelstroms to mark dangerous maritime currents[^16][^17].
* Fords, ferries, bridges and aqueduct crossings at fixed river points[^14][^18].
* Coastal deltas, estuaries, fjords and mangrove inlets[^13][^8].
* Reefs and shoals (rocky or coral) that hinder navigation[^10][^2].
* Icebergs, pack-ice leads and seasonal breakup zones for polar voyages[^5][^2].


## 3  Settlement \& Urban Symbols

Scale or tint icons so villages do not hide the base terrain beneath them[^14][^4].

* Capital city, city, town, village, hamlet and roadside inn[^19][^3].

* Tunnel portals and mountain passes for rapid movement through relief[^27][^20].
