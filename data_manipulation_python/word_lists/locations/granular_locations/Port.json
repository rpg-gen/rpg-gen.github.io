  "name": "Port",
  "description": "A busy port town thrives on maritime trade, offering access to exotic goods and distant lands, but the constant flow of strangers creates security challenges. The waterfront provides opportunities for smuggling and piracy, while the diverse population offers unique cultural experiences.",
  "category": "Settlement",
  "atmosphere": "Ships' masts create a forest of rigging while salty air carries exotic spices and fresh fish. The waterfront bustles with sailors, merchants, and travelers from distant lands. Creaking ships, lapping waves, and dockworker calls fill the air. Warehouses and taverns line the busy quays alongside coils of rope and cargo crates."
