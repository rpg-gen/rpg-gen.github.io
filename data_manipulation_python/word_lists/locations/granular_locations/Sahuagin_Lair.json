  "name": "Sahuagin Lair",
  "description": "A dangerous underwater base serves as home to sahuagin and other hostile aquatic creatures. The sahuagin equipment and potential underwater treasures attract adventurers and treasure hunters, while the hostile sahuagin and underwater environment create constant danger.",
  "category": "Underwater",
  "atmosphere": "The guttural growls and hisses of sahuagin echo through the water, while the clank of underwater weapons and the sound of hostile movements create a symphony of underwater menace. The air carries the metallic scent of underwater weapons and the sharp tang of sahuagin musk, mixed with the briny smell of saltwater and the metallic tang of hidden treasures. Dark underwater chambers loom like underwater caves, while sahuagin equipment and weapons gleam with malevolent purpose. Hostile aquatic creatures patrol the lair, while underwater treasures rest in hidden chambers like bait in a trap. Your skin crawls with the sense of being watched, while the hostile atmosphere makes every shadow seem to hold hidden danger."
