  "atmosphere": "Arcane symbols glow with eerie blue light carved into stone walls. The air crackles with magical energy and strange bubbling sounds drift from upper floors. Sharp scents of sulfur, rare herbs, and old parchment mingle in the air. Floating books and crystalline apparatus hover near spiral staircases."
