  "name": "Ravine",
  "description": "A steep-sided ravine cuts through the landscape, often hiding streams or ancient paths. The dense vegetation provides cover for bandits, while the unstable ground can collapse without warning.",
  "category": "Natural",
  "atmosphere": "Running water echoes from below. Dense undergrowth rustles with unseen movement. Filtered light creates shifting shadows. Thick air scented of damp earth and decay. Steep walls create natural trench feeling."
