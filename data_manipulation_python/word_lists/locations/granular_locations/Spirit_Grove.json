  "description": "A forest clearing where nature spirits are particularly active, creating a place of natural magic and spiritual connection. The spiritual connection provides opportunities for druidic magic and natural research, while the nature spirits can be both helpful and dangerous depending on how they are approached.",
  "category": "Magical",
  "atmosphere": "The whisper of ancient trees and the rustle of spirit voices blend into a constant murmur, like the forest itself is breathing and speaking. The air carries the rich scent of loam and fresh growth, mixed with the sweet perfume of wildflowers and the sharp tang of pine resin. Ethereal forms flicker between the trees, their shapes shifting from humanoid to animal to pure light. Moss-covered stones and fallen logs are arranged in patterns that seem too deliberate to be natural. The air feels alive with energy, and every leaf and blade of grass seems to pulse with its own inner light. Your skin tingles with the touch of natural magic, and the ground beneath your feet feels warm and alive, as if the earth itself is aware of your presence."
