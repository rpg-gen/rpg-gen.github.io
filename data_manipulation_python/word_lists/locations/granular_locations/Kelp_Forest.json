  "atmosphere": "Giant kelp stalks sway and whisper in the ocean currents, creating a gentle, rhythmic sound like underwater wind through trees. The air carries the fresh, green scent of living kelp and sea plants, mixed with the salty tang of marine life and the earthy smell of underwater soil. Sunlight filters through the kelp canopy in dappled patterns, creating an underwater forest floor where light and shadow dance. Schools of fish dart between the kelp stalks, while sea otters and other marine creatures move through the underwater forest like forest animals. Your skin feels the gentle caress of swaying kelp fronds, while the peaceful underwater forest atmosphere creates a sense of natural sanctuary."
