  "atmosphere": "A haunting melody fills the air, the sound of stone singing with voices that seem to come from deep within the earth itself. The air carries the earthy scent of ancient stone, mixed with the sweet smell of musical magic and the sharp tang of vibrating crystal. Each stone pulses with its own rhythm, creating harmonies that shift and change with the wind. Musical runes and magical symbols are carved into every surface, their lines glowing with inner light that pulses in time with the music. The stones themselves seem to vibrate with energy, and touching them sends waves of musical magic through your body. The air feels alive with sound, and every step seems to create new harmonies in the ancient song."
