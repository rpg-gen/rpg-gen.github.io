  "name": "Chaos Rift",
  "description": "A chaotic tear connects to the Abyss, providing access to the realm of demons and pure chaos. The chaotic connection provides opportunities for chaotic magic and demonic research, while the chaotic nature and potential demonic threats create constant danger.",
  "category": "Planar",
  "atmosphere": "The rift's edges writhe like living flesh while demonic laughter echoes from impossible depths. Reality bleeds into twisted geometries around the tear. Demonic runes glow with malevolent light as fragments of broken worlds drift through the void. The air reeks of entropy and corrupted magic."
