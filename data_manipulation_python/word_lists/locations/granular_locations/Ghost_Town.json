  "name": "Ghost Town",
  "description": "A settlement where the boundary between the living and dead is thin, creating a place where spirits and mortals can interact. The spiritual connection provides opportunities for communication with the dead and spiritual research, while the ghostly inhabitants can be both helpful and dangerous.",
  "category": "Magical",
  "atmosphere": "Echoes of long-dead conversations drift through the air, voices speaking in languages and dialects from centuries past. The air carries the musty scent of old wood and forgotten memories, mixed with the sharp tang of ozone and the sweet smell of funeral flowers. Translucent figures move through walls and buildings, their forms flickering like candle flames in the wind. Cobwebs hang from every surface, catching dust motes that dance in the pale light. The temperature drops dramatically when spirits pass nearby, and the air feels thick with the weight of unfulfilled desires. Your skin prickles with goosebumps, and every shadow seems to move with a life of its own."
