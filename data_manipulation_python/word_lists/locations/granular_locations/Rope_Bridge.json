  "name": "Rope Bridge",
  "description": "A simple bridge made of ropes and planks provides crossing over difficult terrain. The lightweight construction allows crossing where other bridges are impossible, while the fragile nature creates constant danger of collapse.",
  "category": "Infrastructure",
  "atmosphere": "Creaking ropes sway with every gust while wooden planks shift beneath your feet like a living thing. The air carries the scent of rope, wood, and the ever-present threat of collapse. Every step feels like a gamble with gravity. Your skin feels the rough rope and the sense of precarious balance. The taste of danger and impossible access fills your mouth."
