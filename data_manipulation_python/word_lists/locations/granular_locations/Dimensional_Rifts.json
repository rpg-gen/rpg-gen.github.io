  "atmosphere": "Whispers of other worlds echo through the air. The scent of ozone and burning reality stings your nostrils. Reality itself ripples and warps before your eyes like heat distortion. Shards of broken space-time float like glass fragments. Your skin tingles with the electric charge of dimensional instability. Gravity feels wrong, pulling in impossible directions."
