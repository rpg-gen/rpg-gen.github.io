  "description": "A network of underground tunnels carries waste and rainwater, creating a hidden world beneath the city streets. The constant flow provides access to all parts of the city, while the toxic environment and dangerous creatures make it a deadly shortcut for those who dare to use it.",
  "category": "Dungeon",
  "atmosphere": "Dripping water and distant scurrying echo through passages. Air thick with stench of decay, waste, and something worse lurking in shadows. Dark tunnels stretch beneath city like veins carrying civilization waste. Feet splash through foul water that seems to cling to skin. Taste of filth and danger fills mouth. Oppressive darkness hides threats that could emerge from any direction."
