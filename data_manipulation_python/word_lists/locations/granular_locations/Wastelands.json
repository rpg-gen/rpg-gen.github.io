  "name": "Wastelands",
  "description": "Barren, lifeless terrain offers no resources or shelter, creating extreme survival challenges. The lack of water and vegetation makes long-term habitation impossible, while the harsh conditions can preserve ancient ruins or artifacts.",
  "category": "Natural",
  "atmosphere": "Barren ground stretches endlessly under a merciless sun while heat waves create shimmering mirages. Cracked earth and scattered bones mark this lifeless expanse. The bone-dry air carries only dust and despair. Nothing grows in this forsaken landscape except perhaps hardy cacti or thorny shrubs."
