  "name": "Time-dilated Regions",
  "description": "Areas where time flows differently create unique experiences and potential research opportunities. The temporal magic provides opportunities for time-based research and unique experiences, while the unpredictable time effects create constant danger of temporal displacement or aging.",
  "category": "Magical",
  "atmosphere": "Time flows at different rates throughout the area while reality flickers between past and future moments. Clocks run at impossible speeds or stop entirely as temporal energy creates visible distortions. Ancient events replay alongside glimpses of possible futures. Chronometric devices malfunction in the unstable timestream."
