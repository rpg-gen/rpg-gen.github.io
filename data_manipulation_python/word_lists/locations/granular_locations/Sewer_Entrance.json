  "name": "Sewer Entrance",
  "description": "A critical utility or transit point; adventurers might sabotage, defend, or navigate the settlement through it.",
  "category": "",
  "atmosphere": "The sewer entrance has a dank, unpleasant atmosphere with the overwhelming scent of waste and the sound of flowing water echoing through the underground tunnels. The air carries the weight of the city's hidden infrastructure and the essential nature of sanitation, while the atmosphere crackles with the tension of exploring dangerous underground passages and the constant threat of disease and filth."
