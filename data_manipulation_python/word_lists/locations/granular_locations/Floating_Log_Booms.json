  "name": "Floating Log Booms",
  "description": "Collections of logs secured together for transport down rivers provide efficient transportation of timber. The floating nature makes transportation efficient, while the valuable cargo attracts both legitimate traders and thieves.",
  "category": "Infrastructure",
  "atmosphere": "River water slaps against timber with wet percussion while rope bindings creak with tension on floating platforms. The air carries the scent of fresh wood, river mist, and the promise of efficient transportation. Every surface feels the tug of relentless current. Your skin feels the river water and the sense of floating vulnerability. The taste of fresh wood and river transport fills your mouth."
