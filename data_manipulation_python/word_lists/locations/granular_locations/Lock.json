  "name": "Lock",
  "description": "A device for raising and lowering boats between different water levels provides access through elevation changes. The mechanical complexity requires skilled operation and maintenance, while the strategic importance makes it vulnerable to sabotage.",
  "category": "Infrastructure",
  "atmosphere": "Water flows and mechanical gears grind while the lock system rises and falls with hydraulic precision. The air carries the scent of water, metal, and the promise of mechanical operation. Every surface vibrates with mechanical complexity. Your skin feels the metal's cold and the weight of strategic vulnerability. The taste of mechanical complexity and hydraulic power fills your mouth."
