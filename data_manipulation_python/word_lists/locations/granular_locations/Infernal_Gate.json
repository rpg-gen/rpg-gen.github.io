  "name": "Infernal Gate",
  "description": "A hellish portal connects to the Nine Hells, providing access to the realm of devils and infernal power. The infernal connection provides opportunities for infernal magic and demonic research, while the hellish nature and potential infernal threats create constant danger.",
  "category": "Planar",
  "atmosphere": "Screams and crackling flames echo from beyond the gate while rusted chains hang like dead serpents. Hellfire burns in unnatural colors - crimson, obsidian, and sickly green. The air reeks of brimstone and molten metal. Torture implements and bone fragments litter the scorched ground around the portal."
