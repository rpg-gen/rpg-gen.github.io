  "name": "Abandoned Mine",
  "description": "A deserted mining operation contains valuable deposits left behind when the miners fled, along with their tools and personal effects. The abandoned equipment and remaining minerals attract scavengers, while the unstable tunnels and dangerous conditions create constant risk of collapse.",
  "category": "Dungeon",
  "atmosphere": "Rotting support timbers groan ominously while rusted equipment lies scattered throughout unstable tunnels. The air carries dust, old sweat, and abandoned dreams. Valuable ore veins glitter in walls scarred by desperate excavation. Cave-ins block several passages and loose rocks litter the uneven floor."
