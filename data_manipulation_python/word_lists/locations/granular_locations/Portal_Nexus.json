  "atmosphere": "A cacophony of alien languages and mechanical whirs fills the air, punctuated by the crackle of energy and the hum of dimensional engines. The scent of ozone and exotic spices mingles with the metallic tang of portal energy and the sweet smell of unknown flowers. Portals of every size and color swirl and pulse around you, each one a window to another world. Strange artifacts and glowing crystals float in containment fields, their surfaces etched with runes that hurt to look at directly. The air itself feels thick and charged, like breathing through a thunderstorm. Your skin crawls with the sensation of being watched by countless eyes from other dimensions, and the ground vibrates with the constant opening and closing of gateways."
