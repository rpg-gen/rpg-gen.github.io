  "description": "Underground excavations for precious stones provide valuable materials and dangerous but profitable employment. The valuable gems create wealth and attract thieves, while the dangerous work creates health and safety risks.",

  "atmosphere": "Pickaxes strike stone with rhythmic percussion while precious gems glitter like trapped starlight in dark tunnels. The air carries the scent of dust, earth, and the promise of wealth. Every surface feels the weight of economic opportunity. Your skin feels the stone and the sense of criminal temptation. The taste of precious wealth and mining opportunity fills your mouth."
