  "description": "A hub of local governance or public administration; adventurers may seek permits, records, or appeal to authorities.",
  "category": "",
  "atmosphere": "The office is filled with the scent of ink, parchment, and the musty smell of old records. The sound of quills scratching on paper and the rustle of documents being filed creates a methodical, bureaucratic rhythm. Shelves of ledgers and official documents line the walls, while the air carries the weight of official business and procedure."
