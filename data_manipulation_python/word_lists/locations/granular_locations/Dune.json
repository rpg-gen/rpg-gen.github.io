  "name": "Dune",
  "description": "Shifting sand dunes create a constantly changing landscape that can disorient travelers. The soft sand makes travel difficult, but the dunes can hide ancient ruins or valuable resources buried beneath the surface.",
  "category": "Natural",
  "atmosphere": "Sand shifts beneath feet with every step. Constantly changing landscape seems alive. Wind creates dune ripples with strange whispering sounds. Endless curves create otherworldly beauty. Easy to lose bearings in sea of sand. Dry, hot air scented of sun-baked sand."
