  "name": "Causeway",
  "description": "A raised road built across wetlands or water provides reliable transportation through difficult terrain. The elevated construction prevents flooding and provides stable footing, while the isolated nature makes it vulnerable to attack.",
  "category": "Infrastructure",
  "atmosphere": "Water laps against stone sides while wind whispers across wetlands on both sides. The air carries the scent of water, earth, and the promise of elevated crossing. Every step feels isolated and exposed above the water. Your skin feels the wind's touch and the sense of isolated vulnerability. The taste of reliable transportation and exposed positioning fills your mouth."
