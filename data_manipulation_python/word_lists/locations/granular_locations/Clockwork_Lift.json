  "name": "Clockwork Lift",
  "description": "A mechanical elevator system powered by complex clockwork mechanisms provides reliable vertical transportation. The mechanical transportation provides access to otherwise inaccessible areas, while the complex mechanisms and potential mechanical failure create constant danger.",
  "category": "Infrastructure",
  "atmosphere": "Gears click and whir with mechanical precision while brass cogs spin behind glass panels. Steam hisses from pressure valves as chains rattle overhead. The air carries sharp scents of oiled metal and heated brass. Polished brass fittings and gauges line the lift's walls."
