  "name": "Cove",
  "description": "A small, hidden cove provides perfect concealment for smugglers or secret meetings, but the limited space restricts large-scale operations. The sheltered waters are ideal for small boats, while the surrounding cliffs can hide caves or lookout posts.",
  "category": "Natural",
  "atmosphere": "Hidden gem of sheltered water tucked behind natural barriers. Calm, protected waters create privacy and seclusion. Cliff amphitheater amplifies sounds like secret world. Limited space creates intimacy. Hidden nature feels like place of secrets and intrigue. Fresh salt water and marine life scent."
