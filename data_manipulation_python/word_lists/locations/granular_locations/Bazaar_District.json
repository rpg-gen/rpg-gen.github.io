  "name": "Bazaar District",
  "description": "A sprawling marketplace district with countless stalls and shops; adventurers can find exotic goods, meet merchants from distant lands, or get lost in the maze of commerce.",
  "category": "",
  "atmosphere": "A cacophony of voices haggling in dozens of languages fills the air. The scent of exotic spices, fresh produce, and cooking food mingles with the sound of coins clinking. Colorful awnings create a patchwork canopy overhead, and the press of bodies creates a constant hum of activity."
