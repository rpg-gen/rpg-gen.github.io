  "name": "Living Garden",
  "description": "A magical garden where plants are sentient and can communicate, creating a place of natural intelligence and botanical magic. The sentient plants provide opportunities for druidic magic and botanical research, while the intelligent flora can be both helpful and dangerous depending on their disposition.",
  "category": "Magical",
  "atmosphere": "Vines and flowers turn to track movement with obvious intelligence while leaves rustle in patterns too deliberate for natural wind. Rich earth and chlorophyll scents fill air thick with pollen. Plants pulse with bioluminescent patterns as curious tendrils reach toward visitors. Root networks form geometric patterns in the soil."
