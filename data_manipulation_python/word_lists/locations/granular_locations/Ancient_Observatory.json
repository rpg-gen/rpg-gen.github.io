  "category": "Ruin",
  "atmosphere": "Broken telescopes and astrolabes lie scattered among star charts and astronomical instruments. Stone platforms once held celestial devices now point uselessly at empty sky. The air carries old parchment and metallic tang of corroded brass. Carved constellations cover walls and ceilings in intricate detail."
