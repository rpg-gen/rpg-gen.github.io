  "description": "A mystical portal connects to the realm of dreams, providing access to the collective unconscious and dream magic. The dream connection provides opportunities for dream magic and psychological research, while the dream nature and potential dream threats create constant danger.",
  "category": "Planar",
  "atmosphere": "Dream whispers echo with the voices of a thousand sleeping minds, their words shifting between languages and meanings. The air carries the ethereal scent of moonbeams and forgotten memories, with hints of childhood wonder and subconscious fears. The portal's surface ripples with ever-changing imagesâ€”faces, places, and moments from countless dreams. Dream symbols float like smoke, their meanings shifting with each heartbeat, while fragments of memories drift like dust motes in moonlight. Your consciousness feels fluid, as if the boundary between waking and dreaming has dissolved entirely."
