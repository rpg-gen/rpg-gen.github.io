  "name": "Animal Trail",
  "description": "A narrow path created by animal movement provides basic access through wilderness areas. The natural formation makes it free to use, while the narrow width and rough surface limit the types of traffic and speed.",
  "category": "Infrastructure",
  "atmosphere": "Narrow path worn by wild animals winds through dense wilderness while tracks and scat mark regular use by various creatures. Natural route requires single file travel as branches and undergrowth crowd the passage. Following game trails offers the best hope of navigation through untamed land."
