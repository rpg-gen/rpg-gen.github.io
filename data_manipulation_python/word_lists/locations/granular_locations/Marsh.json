  "name": "Marsh",
  "description": "A shallow marsh provides excellent hunting grounds and natural barriers, but the soft ground makes travel difficult. The abundant wildlife offers food and materials, while the limited visibility can hide both opportunities and threats.",
  "category": "Natural",
  "atmosphere": "Water lapping against vegetation and marsh bird calls. Air thick with wet earth and growing things scent. Tall grasses and reeds rustle with hidden wildlife. Soft ground makes every step uncertain. Limited visibility through tall grasses. Natural maze of water and reeds."
