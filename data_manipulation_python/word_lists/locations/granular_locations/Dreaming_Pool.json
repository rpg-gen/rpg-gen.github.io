The prophetic magic provides opportunities for divination and spiritual insight, while the dream magic can be both enlightening and dangerous, potentially trapping visitors in eternal sleep.",

  "atmosphere": "Still water reflects visions of distant places and unknown faces instead of the sky above. Lotus flowers bloom and wilt in moments along the pool's edge. Sweet, drowsy scents fill the air while crystal orbs and dreamcatchers surround the water. Soft whispers seem to rise from the depths."
