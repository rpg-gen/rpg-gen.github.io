  "category": "Dungeon",
  "atmosphere": "Hammers striking metal echo through chambers like rhythmic heartbeat. Air carries hot metal, coal smoke, and powerful weapons scent. Intense heat radiates from massive forges making air shimmer with heat waves. Skin burns with heat of forges. Taste of metal and fire fills mouth. Weight of dangerous machinery and valuable equipment makes heart race with possibility and danger."
