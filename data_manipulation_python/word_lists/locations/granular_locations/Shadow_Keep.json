  "description": "A fortress exists partially in the Shadowfell, creating a dark and twisted version of a normal castle with shadow magic and undead guardians. The shadow magic and unique materials can be extremely valuable, while the dark nature and undead inhabitants create constant supernatural danger.",
  "category": "Dungeon",
  "atmosphere": "Dark fortress exists between worlds with shadows moving with malevolent intelligence. Air carries death, shadow magic, and something that defies reality scent. Skin crawls with presence of undead guardians and shadow magic. Taste of death and supernatural danger fills mouth. Weight of shadow magic and undead inhabitants presses down like physical force."
