  "name": "Ship Graveyard",
  "description": "A collection of sunken vessels creates an underwater archaeological site with multiple ships and their cargo. The multiple shipwrecks and historical significance attract treasure hunters and archaeologists, while the underwater environment and potential marine threats create constant danger.",
  "category": "Underwater",
  "atmosphere": "The mournful creak of ancient timbers echoes through the water, while the gentle lapping of waves against multiple hulls creates a symphony of underwater sorrow. The air carries the musty scent of old wood and rusted metal, mixed with the briny smell of saltwater and the metallic tang of scattered artifacts. Sunken ships loom like underwater ghosts, their broken masts reaching toward the surface like skeletal fingers. Barnacles and coral formations encrust every surface, while scattered coins and artifacts gleam like underwater stars in the sediment. Your skin feels the weight of history and loss, while the eerie atmosphere makes every shadow seem to hold the memories of lost sailors."
