  "name": "Cliff",
  "description": "A towering cliff face offers spectacular views and defensive positions, but climbing presents mortal danger. The base often contains caves or mineral deposits, while the top provides strategic control of the surrounding area.",
  "category": "Natural",
  "atmosphere": "Wind howls around sheer rock face with stone and sea scent. From top: world spreads like living map. From below: natural fortress wall. Waves and wind create background symphony. Exposed position feels powerful yet vulnerable."
