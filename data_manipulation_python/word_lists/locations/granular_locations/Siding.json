  "description": "A short section of track for parking vehicles provides operational flexibility for transportation systems. The simple construction allows for easy expansion, while the limited capacity restricts its use to specific operational needs.",
  "category": "Infrastructure",
  "atmosphere": "Idling engines hum while metal clanks and echoes through the short track section. The air carries the scent of iron rails, engine oil, and the promise of operational efficiency. Every surface feels utilitarian and functional. Your skin feels the gravel ballast and the sense of operational flexibility. The taste of mechanical efficiency and limited capacity fills your mouth."
