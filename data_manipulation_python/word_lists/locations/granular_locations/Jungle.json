  "name": "Jungle",
  "description": "An impenetrable jungle creates natural barriers and hides ancient ruins, but the hostile environment makes survival difficult. The dense vegetation provides excellent cover for ambushes, while the constant heat and humidity can sap strength quickly.",
  "category": "Natural",
  "atmosphere": "Wall of green that actively resists passage. Dense vegetation creates own microclimate. Sounds muffled and distorted by thick foliage. Every step requires effort. Constant heat saps energy. Dense cover makes you feel watched. Heavy, humid air scented of rot, exotic flowers, and animal musk."
