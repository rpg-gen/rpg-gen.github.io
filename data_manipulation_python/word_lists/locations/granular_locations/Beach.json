  "name": "Beach",
  "description": "A sandy beach offers easy access to the sea and abundant shellfish, but the exposed position makes it vulnerable to storms and attacks. The open terrain provides no cover, while the tides can reveal or hide valuable flotsam and shipwrecks.",
  "category": "Natural",
  "atmosphere": "Meeting place of land and sea with sand stretching between worlds. Waves crashing creates constant rhythm. Open terrain provides unobstructed sea and sky views. Exposed position creates freedom and vulnerability. Tides constantly reshape landscape, revealing and hiding treasures. Fresh salt water and marine life scent."
