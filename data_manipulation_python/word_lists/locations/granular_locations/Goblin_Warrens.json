  "name": "Goblin Warrens",
  "description": "A complex network of tunnels and chambers serves as home to a goblin tribe, with living quarters, workshops, and storage areas. The goblin craftsmanship and stolen goods attract traders and adventurers, while the numerous goblins and their traps create constant danger.",
  "category": "Dungeon",
  "atmosphere": "Low tunnels connect chaotic chambers filled with crude furniture and stolen goods. Sharp scents of goblin musk and rancid food fill the stale air. Tripwires and pit traps are hastily concealed throughout the warren. Countless small eyes gleam from dark crevices and hidden alcoves."
