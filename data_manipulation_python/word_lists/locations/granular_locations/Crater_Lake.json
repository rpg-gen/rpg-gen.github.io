  "name": "Crater Lake",
  "description": "A lake formed in a volcanic crater creates a unique and often beautiful natural feature. The steep crater walls provide excellent defensive positions, while the isolated nature can preserve unique ecosystems or ancient secrets.",
  "category": "Natural",
  "atmosphere": "Impossibly blue water fills the ancient volcanic crater while steep walls create a natural amphitheater. The isolated lake seems untouched by outside world as perfectly still water reflects surrounding cliffs. Volcanic minerals tint the air with subtle scents. Few access points make this a hidden sanctuary."
