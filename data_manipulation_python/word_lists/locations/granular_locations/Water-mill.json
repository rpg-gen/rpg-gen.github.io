  "atmosphere": "Large water wheel turns steadily in the flowing stream while mechanical gears transfer power to grinding stones. The mill race channels water flow for maximum efficiency as flour dust settles on wooden beams. Reliable water power ensures consistent grain processing. The air carries fresh water and milled grain."
