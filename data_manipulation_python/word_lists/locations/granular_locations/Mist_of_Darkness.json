  "name": "Mist of Darkness",
  "description": "An area obscured by magical or natural fog creates uncertainty and potential hiding places. The obscured nature creates opportunities for stealth and ambush, while the limited visibility creates constant danger and uncertainty.",
  "category": "Magical",
  "atmosphere": "Dense fog blankets the area creating impenetrable walls of mist while visibility drops to mere feet ahead. Dampness clings to everything as sounds become muffled and distorted. Perfect conditions for ambush and concealment. Navigation becomes dangerous guesswork in the white void."
