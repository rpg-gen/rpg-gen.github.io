  "atmosphere": "The roar of endless flames fills your ears, a constant symphony of crackling, hissing, and roaring that drowns out all other sounds. The air burns with the acrid scent of sulfur and ash, mixed with the sweet smell of burning wood and the metallic tang of molten metal. Living flames dance and writhe around you, their forms shifting between humanoid shapes and pure fire. Crystalline formations of obsidian and fire opal line the rift, their surfaces glowing with inner heat and reflecting the dancing flames. The heat is so intense it feels like breathing fire, and every surface radiates scorching warmth. Your skin feels like it's being slowly cooked, and the air is so dry it pulls moisture from your body with every breath."
