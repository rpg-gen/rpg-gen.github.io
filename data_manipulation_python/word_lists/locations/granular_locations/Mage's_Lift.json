  "description": "A magical elevator system provides vertical transportation through difficult terrain or between different levels of a settlement. The magical transportation provides access to otherwise inaccessible areas, while the magical nature and potential magical failure create constant danger.",
  "category": "Infrastructure",
  "atmosphere": "Glowing runes power a platform that rises smoothly through impossible vertical spaces. Arcane energy hums through crystalline conduits while magical circles provide stable footing. The air crackles with dimensional magic and ozone. Floating crystals illuminate the shaft as the platform defies gravity."
