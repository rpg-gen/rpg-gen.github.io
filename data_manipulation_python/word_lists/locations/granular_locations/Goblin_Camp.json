  "description": "A chaotic settlement of goblins creates a dangerous but potentially profitable environment. The goblin craftsmanship and stolen goods attract traders, while the numerous goblins and their traps create constant danger.",
  "category": "Settlement",
  "atmosphere": "Ramshackle huts built from scavenged materials house goblin workshops filled with crude inventions. Mechanical traps click and whir throughout the chaotic settlement. The air carries acrid tinkering scents and stolen goods. Small eyes peer from every shadow and crevice."
