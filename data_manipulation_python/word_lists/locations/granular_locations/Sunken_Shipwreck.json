  "name": "Sunken Shipwreck",
  "description": "A vessel lost beneath the waves contains valuable cargo and historical artifacts, while providing habitat for marine life. The preserved cargo and historical significance attract treasure hunters and scholars, while the underwater environment and potential aquatic threats create constant danger.",
  "category": "Underwater",
  "atmosphere": "Broken timbers creak and groan as water flows through the ship's skeleton. Barnacles and coral crust every surface while schools of fish dart through broken portholes. Scattered coins and artifacts gleam in filtered sunlight. The briny scent of saltwater mingles with rotting wood and marine growth."
