  "name": "Sunken City",
  "description": "A once-great city now lies beneath the waves, preserved by the water and containing the remains of an entire civilization. The underwater environment creates unique challenges and opportunities, while the preserved buildings and artifacts offer glimpses into lost history and culture.",
  "category": "Dungeon",
  "atmosphere": "Distant echoes of water movement create eerie underwater symphony. Taste of salt and ancient secrets fills mouth. Ancient buildings loom through murky water like ghosts of forgotten civilization. Fingers brush against stonework worn smooth by centuries of water. Cold pressure squeezes chest as you explore streets that once bustled with life. Weight of entire lost civilization presses down on you."
