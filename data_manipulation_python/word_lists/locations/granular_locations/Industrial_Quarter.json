  "description": "A smoky district filled with factories, forges, and workshops; adventurers can find work, purchase industrial goods, or investigate industrial accidents.",
  "category": "",
  "atmosphere": "Thick black smoke billows from tall chimneys, creating a perpetual haze that blocks the sun. The constant roar of machinery and the clang of metal on metal fills the air. The scent of burning coal, hot metal, and industrial chemicals hangs heavy, while workers with soot-stained faces hurry between workshops."
