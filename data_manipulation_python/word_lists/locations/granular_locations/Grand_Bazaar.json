  "name": "Grand Bazaar",
  "description": "A vast grand bazaar serves as the ultimate marketplace with goods from around the world, offering unlimited shopping opportunities and cultural exchange, but the overwhelming size and diversity can be both exciting and dangerous. The commercial focus creates opportunities for profit and cultural exchange, while the concentration of wealth attracts both legitimate merchants and criminals.",
  "category": "Settlement",
  "atmosphere": "Covered passages and narrow alleys create a maze of merchant stalls selling goods from every corner of the world. Dozens of languages blend in constant haggling while incense, spices, and exotic perfumes fill the air. Silk banners and colorful awnings shade valuable merchandise. Guards patrol the main thoroughfares."
