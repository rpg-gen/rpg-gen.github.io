  "name": "Pier",
  "description": "A platform extending over water provides access for fishing, recreation, and small boat mooring. The waterfront location offers opportunities for fishing and maritime activities, while the exposed position makes it vulnerable to storms and attack.",
  "category": "Settlement",
  "atmosphere": "Wooden platform extends over the water while fishermen cast lines from the railings. Gentle waves lap against the pilings as sea breeze carries salt and marine scents. Small boats moor alongside while seabirds search for scraps. Simple but essential access to the water."
