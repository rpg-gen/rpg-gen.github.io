  "name": "Crumbling Aqueduct",
  "description": "A broken aqueduct that once supplied water to a settlement now creates a dangerous obstacle and potential source of flooding. The engineering knowledge and construction materials can be valuable, while the water flow can create new paths or hazards in the landscape.",
  "category": "Ruin",
  "atmosphere": "Footsteps echo on crumbling stone that once carried life-giving water. Air carries rushing water, old stone, and engineering knowledge scent. Broken stone arches stand like skeletal remains of ancient engineering marvels. Skin tingles with sense of dangerous obstacles and valuable materials. Taste of lost engineering and potential flooding fills mouth. Weight of broken engineering and water flow presses down on you."
