  "name": "Cooperage",
  "description": "A workshop where barrels and casks are made; adventurers can purchase storage containers, learn about aging processes, or find hidden compartments in barrels.",
  "category": "",
  "atmosphere": "The workshop is filled with the rich scent of wood and the sharp tang of metal hoops. The sound of hammers striking wood and the rhythmic work of barrel-making creates a methodical, industrious background. Stacks of finished barrels and half-completed casks line the space, while the air carries the promise of storage and preservation."
