  "name": "Starfall Crater",
  "description": "A crater created by a falling star contains celestial magic and materials from beyond the mortal world. The celestial materials and magic provide opportunities for powerful crafting and astronomical research, while the celestial nature and potential cosmic threats create constant danger.",
  "category": "Magical",
  "atmosphere": "The air crackles with static electricity as you descend into the crater, and you hear a faint, high-pitched hum that seems to come from the very stones beneath your feet. The scent of ozone and something metallic—like the smell of a forge mixed with starlight—fills your nostrils. Your skin prickles with goosebumps as you feel the residual heat from the impact still radiating from the crater walls. Embedded in the crater's sides are strange crystals that pulse with rainbow colors, and scattered across the floor are chunks of metal that seem to glow with their own inner light. Small pools of liquid starlight shimmer in the crater's depths, casting dancing reflections on the walls."
