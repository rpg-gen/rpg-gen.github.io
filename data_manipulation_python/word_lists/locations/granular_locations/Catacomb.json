  "description": "A vast network of burial tunnels provides space for thousands of dead, creating a maze of chambers and passages. The complex layout can hide secret passages and valuable artifacts, while the overwhelming presence of death can drive intruders mad or attract undead guardians.",
  "category": "Dungeon",
  "atmosphere": "Endless tunnels stretch in every direction lined with thousands of dead bones. Air thick with cloying decay and old earth scent. Footsteps echo through maze designed to confuse and trap. Taste of death and madness fills mouth. Skin crawls with overwhelming presence of countless souls. Weight of so much death threatens to crush sanity."
