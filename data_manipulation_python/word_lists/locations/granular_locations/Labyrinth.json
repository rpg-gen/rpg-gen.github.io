  "name": "Labyrinth",
  "description": "A deliberately confusing maze of passages and chambers serves as both puzzle and prison, designed to trap and disorient intruders. The complex layout can hide valuable treasures at its center, while the endless corridors can drive explorers to exhaustion or madness.",
  "category": "Dungeon",
  "atmosphere": "Footsteps echo through passages that seem to lead nowhere. Air stale and thick with old stone and desperation scent. Endless stone corridors twist and turn in impossible patterns. Dead ends and identical passages create disorienting maze. Skin prickles with sense of being watched by unseen eyes. Weight of endless corridors and growing panic threatens to drive you mad."
