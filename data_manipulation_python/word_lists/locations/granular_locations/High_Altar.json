  "name": "High Altar",
  "description": "A magnificent altar serves as the center of religious worship and divine communication, providing spiritual focus and powerful magical energy. The religious significance provides protection and divine favor, while the concentration of spiritual power attracts both worshippers and those seeking to control or exploit it.",
  "category": "Sacred Site",
  "atmosphere": "Chanting voices rise in perfect harmony with ringing bells and clinking censers. Incense smoke curls through air thick with myrrh, frankincense, and burning candle wax scent. Golden light streams through stained glass windows onto polished marble altar. Fingers trace intricate carvings of divine symbols and sacred texts. Skin prickles with static electricity from concentrated magical energy. Weight of centuries of prayer and divine presence makes air feel heavy and charged."
