  "name": "History Overlay Areas",
  "description": "Places where past events replay or historical periods persist create unique environments and research opportunities. The historical nature provides opportunities for research and unique experiences, while the temporal anomalies create constant danger of temporal displacement.",
  "category": "Magical",
  "atmosphere": "Ghostly images of historical events flicker through the area while echoes of ancient conversations drift on the wind. Past and present overlay creating temporal confusion as long-dead figures move through their eternal routines. The air carries old parchment and the weight of accumulated history."
