  "atmosphere": "The air hums with the soft lullaby of distant dreams. Sweet lavender and moonflower scents drift through the air. Reality itself seems to blur and shift like morning mist. Dream-catchers and sleep-inducing herbs hang from every surface. Your eyelids feel heavy, consciousness slipping between worlds. A gentle floating sensation, as if gravity has lost its grip."
