Stained glass windows cast colorful light onto simple wooden pews and humble altar. Fingers trace worn prayer books and smooth wooden railings used by generations. Skin tingles with sense of community protection and spiritual refuge in intimate space. Weight of community faith and divine protection makes heart feel safe and welcomed."
