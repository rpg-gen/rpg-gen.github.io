  "name": "Cart Track",
  "description": "A simple path suitable for carts and wagons provides basic transportation through rural areas. The simple nature makes it easy to maintain, while the limited capacity restricts large-scale trade and military movement.",
  "category": "Infrastructure",
  "atmosphere": "Simple dirt path worn by generations of cart wheels and pack animals winds through rural countryside. Ruts and stones mark the basic route as wildflowers grow along the edges. Essential but humble connection between farms and villages. Weather can make passage difficult or impossible."
