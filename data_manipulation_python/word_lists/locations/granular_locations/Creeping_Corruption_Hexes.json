  "description": "Areas where dark magic or supernatural corruption slowly spreads create dangerous and unpredictable environments. The corruption poses constant threats to life and sanity, while the dark magic can contain valuable resources or powerful artifacts.",
  "category": "Magical",
  "atmosphere": "Dark tendrils of corruption spread across the landscape while cursed objects and twisted artifacts litter the ground. The air reeks of sulfur and decay as reality itself becomes tainted. Unnatural shadows writhe with malevolent purpose. Even brief exposure risks mental corruption and physical transformation."
