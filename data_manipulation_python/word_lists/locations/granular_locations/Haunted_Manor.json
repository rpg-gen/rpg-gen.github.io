  "name": "Haunted Manor",
  "description": "A grand house that once housed a wealthy family now lies abandoned and haunted by restless spirits. The architectural beauty and potential hidden treasures attract explorers, while the supernatural inhabitants create constant danger and opportunities for ghost hunting or exorcism.",
  "category": "Ruin",
  "atmosphere": "Dust sheets cover ornate furniture while portraits watch with eyes that seem to follow movement. Cold drafts flow through grand hallways despite closed windows. The scent of old roses and decay lingers in elegant rooms. Footsteps echo from empty chambers and doors creak open on their own."
