  "name": "Slums",
  "description": "A poverty-stricken area with overcrowded tenements and desperate residents; adventurers can find cheap lodging, gather street information, or help the downtrodden.",
  "category": "",
  "atmosphere": "The district is a maze of narrow, filthy streets lined with ramshackle buildings that lean precariously against each other. The air is thick with the stench of garbage, sewage, and despair. The sound of crying children, arguing adults, and the constant struggle for survival creates an atmosphere of desperation and hopelessness."
