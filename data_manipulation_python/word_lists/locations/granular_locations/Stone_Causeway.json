  "description": "A raised road built across difficult terrain provides reliable transportation through swamps, marshes, or other challenging environments. The reliable transportation provides access to difficult areas, while the isolated nature and potential structural failure create constant danger.",

  "atmosphere": "Raised stone roadway stretches across treacherous swampland on solid foundations while warning markers line the safe passage. Difficult terrain flanks both sides as travelers move cautiously along the elevated route. The air carries earthy swamp scents and solid stone. Moss and water stains mark the causeway's age."
