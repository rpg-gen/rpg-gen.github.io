  "name": "Wooden Bridge",
  "description": "A bridge constructed of timber provides essential crossing over water obstacles. The wooden construction makes it vulnerable to fire and decay, while the simpler construction allows for quicker building and repair.",

  "atmosphere": "Creaking timber groans with each step while flowing water whispers beneath wooden planks. The air carries the scent of fresh wood, water, and the constant threat of decay. Every board feels temporary and vulnerable. Your skin feels the rough wood grain and the sense of impermanence. The taste of essential access and temporary construction fills your mouth."
