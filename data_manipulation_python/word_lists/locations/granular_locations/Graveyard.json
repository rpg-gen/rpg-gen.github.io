  "description": "A peaceful graveyard provides burial services and connection to the deceased, offering spiritual comfort and community, but the association with death creates fear and superstition. The sacred nature provides protection and respect, while the focus on death can attract both mourners and grave robbers.",

  "atmosphere": "Weathered headstones stand in neat rows among tall grass and wildflowers. Morning mist clings to marble monuments and iron gates. The sweet scent of flowers mingles with turned earth. Fresh bouquets and flickering candles mark recent visits."
