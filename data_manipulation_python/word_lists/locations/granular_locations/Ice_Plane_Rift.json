  "atmosphere": "The howl of endless wind and the crack of fracturing ice echo through the rift, creating a constant soundtrack of winter's fury. The air carries the sharp, clean scent of pure ice and the metallic tang of frozen metal, mixed with the faint smell of ozone. Living ice formations shift and flow around you, their crystalline structures catching and refracting light in impossible patterns. Massive ice crystals tower overhead, their surfaces etched with intricate frost patterns that seem to move and shift. The cold is so intense it burns like fire, and every breath feels like inhaling needles. Your skin goes numb almost instantly, and the air is so still and cold it feels like time itself has frozen."
