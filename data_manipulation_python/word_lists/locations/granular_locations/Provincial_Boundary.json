  "description": "A border between administrative regions defines local authority and creates opportunities for regional trade and governance. The administrative significance makes it a focus for local politics, while the crossing points create opportunities for regional commerce and information exchange.",
  "category": "Infrastructure",
  "atmosphere": "Administrative boundary marked by regional symbols and local officials while bureaucrats enforce provincial regulations. Local commerce flows through the crossing as regional differences in law and custom become apparent. Smaller scale but still significant political division."
