  "atmosphere": "The constant rustle of nocturnal creatures and the whisper of wind through eternal shadows creates a soundtrack of perpetual night. The air carries the rich scent of damp earth and decaying leaves, mixed with the musky smell of nocturnal animals and the sharp tang of night-blooming flowers. Glowing eyes peer from every shadow, the creatures of eternal night watching with predatory awareness. Bioluminescent fungi and night-blooming flowers provide the only light, their soft glow creating pools of illumination in the endless darkness. The air feels thick and heavy, as if the darkness itself has weight and substance. Your skin prickles with the touch of nocturnal magic, and every shadow seems to move with a life of its own."
