  "name": "Ethereal Crossing",
  "description": "A dimensional bridge connects to the Ethereal Plane, allowing travel through the border between the material and spiritual worlds. The ethereal connection provides opportunities for ghost hunting and spiritual research, while the ethereal nature and potential spiritual threats create constant danger.",
  "category": "Planar",
  "atmosphere": "The bridge's surface feels insubstantial beneath your feet, like walking on mist that somehow supports your weight. You hear the distant sound of wind chimes and the soft rustle of fabric that isn't there. The air carries the faint scent of incense and something sweet that you can't quite identify. Your skin feels cool and slightly damp, as if you're walking through a gentle mist. The bridge's railings are carved with symbols that seem to glow with their own inner light, and scattered across the surface are small offeringsâ€”flowers, coins, and candles that burn with ethereal flames. The air around you shimmers with a pearlescent sheen."
