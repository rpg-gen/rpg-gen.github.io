  "description": "Ancient burial mounds inhabited by undead creatures create dangerous environments with potential treasures. The ancient burial goods and potential magical artifacts attract treasure hunters, while the numerous undead create constant supernatural danger.",
  "category": "Magical",
  "atmosphere": "Rasping breaths and dry bone scraping echo from dark tunnels. The air reeks of ancient rot and embalming spices. Pale hands claw at the earth from shallow graves. Burial offerings and protective amulets scatter across the floor. Your skin crawls with the touch of death magic. The weight of centuries presses down like a physical force."
