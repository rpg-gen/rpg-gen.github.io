  "description": "A mill powered by wind provides grain processing and can pump water or generate power. The elevated position provides excellent visibility, while the dependence on wind makes operation unpredictable.",

  "atmosphere": "Large wind sails catch the breeze while internal gears transfer power to grinding stones. The elevated structure provides excellent views across the countryside as wind power drives the milling process. Variable wind makes operation unpredictable. The building creaks and sways with stronger gusts."
