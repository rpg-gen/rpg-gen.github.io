  "name": "Minor Road",
  "description": "A smaller but maintained road provides essential local transportation and trade routes. The local importance creates opportunities for toll collection and control, while the smaller scale makes it less attractive to large-scale banditry.",
  "category": "Infrastructure",
  "atmosphere": "Maintained dirt road connects smaller communities while local traffic moves at a gentler pace than major highways. Cart ruts and hoof prints mark regular use as roadside shrines provide spiritual comfort. Regional artery linking villages and towns to larger trade networks."
