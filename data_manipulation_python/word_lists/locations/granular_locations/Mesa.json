  "name": "Mesa",
  "description": "A flat-topped mesa rises dramatically from the surrounding plains, offering a natural fortress with commanding views. The steep sides provide excellent defense, but limited water sources and difficult resupply make long-term occupation challenging.",
  "category": "Natural",
  "atmosphere": "Natural castle rising from landscape with wind-catching flat top. World spreads like vast painting from above. Steep sides create sky island feeling. Palpable isolation with only wind and distant birds. Dry air scented of sun-baked stone."
