  "name": "Market Square",
  "description": "A bustling market square serves as the center of commerce and social interaction, offering diverse goods and information, but the concentration of wealth attracts both customers and criminals. The commercial focus creates opportunities for profit and social networking, while the public nature makes it vulnerable to theft and surveillance.",
  "category": "Settlement",
  "atmosphere": "Merchant calls and coin clatter create a constant din of commerce. Colorful stalls overflow with spices, fresh bread, and exotic goods. Canvas awnings create a patchwork canopy overhead. The air fills with mingled scents of leather, herbs, and cooking food."
