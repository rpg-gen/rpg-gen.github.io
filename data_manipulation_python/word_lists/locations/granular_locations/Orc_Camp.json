  "description": "A temporary settlement of orc warriors creates a dangerous and unpredictable environment. The martial culture provides opportunities for mercenary work, while the aggressive nature makes it extremely dangerous for outsiders.",
  "category": "Settlement",
  "atmosphere": "Crude tents surround sparring circles where orc warriors clash weapons in brutal training. War drums pound while cook fires roast questionable meat. The air carries blood, sweat, and weapon oil. Skulls and war trophies decorate tent poles and weapon racks."
