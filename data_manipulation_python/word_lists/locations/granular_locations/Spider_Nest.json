  "name": "Spider Nest",
  "description": "A massive web complex serves as home to giant spiders and their prey, creating a deadly environment of sticky webs and venomous creatures. The spider silk and venom can be valuable materials, while the numerous spiders and their webs create constant danger of entrapment and poisoning.",
  "category": "Dungeon",
  "atmosphere": "Massive webs stretch between every surface creating a three-dimensional maze of silk. The air carries the sweet stench of venom and decomposing prey. Countless spider eyes reflect light from dark crevices while egg sacs hang like grotesque fruit. Desiccated corpses wrapped in silk dangle from the ceiling."
