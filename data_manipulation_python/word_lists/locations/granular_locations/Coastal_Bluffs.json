  "description": "Steep cliffs along the coast create dramatic seascapes and natural defensive positions. The elevated position provides excellent views of maritime activity, while the erosion creates constant change and potential hazards.",
  "category": "Natural",
  "atmosphere": "Steep cliffs overlook pounding surf while constant erosion slowly claims the coastline. Seabirds nest in rocky crevices as salt spray reaches even the highest points. Dramatic meeting place where land battles the eternal sea. Maritime vantage point with spectacular but dangerous views."
