  "name": "Battleground",
  "description": "A historic battleground serves as a memorial and training ground, offering lessons in strategy and courage, but the violent history can attract both honor-seekers and scavengers. The historical significance provides educational value and respect, while the association with violence can create dangerous encounters or spiritual disturbances.",

  "atmosphere": "Scarred earth bears furrows and depressions from ancient battles while fragments of weapons and armor litter the ground. Wind howls across the open field carrying metallic scents of rust and old blood. Weathered memorial stones mark significant positions. Ravens pick through the aftermath of war."
