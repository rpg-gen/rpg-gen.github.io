  "name": "Hamlet",
  "description": "A tiny hamlet of a few families offers intimate community and local knowledge, but limited resources and protection. The close-knit nature makes it easy to gather information, while the small size makes it vulnerable to bandits or natural disasters.",
  "category": "Settlement",
  "atmosphere": "Tiny cluster of homes where everyone knows everyone else. Air carries wood smoke, cooking food, and livestock scent. Children playing and animals calling create peaceful rural symphony. Small size makes every building and person significant. Close-knit nature creates warmth and belonging. Strangers immediately noticeable and potentially unwelcome."
