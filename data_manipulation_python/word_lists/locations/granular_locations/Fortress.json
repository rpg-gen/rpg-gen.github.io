  "name": "Fortress",
  "description": "A massive fortress serves as an impregnable military base and symbol of power, offering ultimate security but also strict control. The military hierarchy creates clear authority structures, while the defensive focus can make it feel like a prison or sanctuary depending on circumstances.",
  "category": "Settlement",
  "atmosphere": "Massive stone walls and defensive towers dominate the landscape while military formations drill on inner courtyards. Armor clanks and weapons clash during training exercises. The air carries stone dust, steel, and authority. Multiple defensive layers protect the central keep with murder holes and battlements."
