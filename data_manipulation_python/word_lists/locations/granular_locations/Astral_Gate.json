  "name": "Astral Gate",
  "description": "A magical gateway connects to the Astral Plane, providing access to the realm of thought and psychic energy. The astral connection provides opportunities for psychic magic and mental research, while the astral nature and potential psychic threats create constant danger.",
  "category": "Planar",
  "atmosphere": "The air around the gateway shimmers like heat waves, and you hear the faint echo of thousands of thoughtsâ€”whispers of memories, fragments of conversations, and the hum of pure consciousness. The scent of lavender and something that reminds you of old books fills the air. Your mind feels strangely clear and focused, as if your thoughts have been sharpened to a fine edge. Carved into the gateway's frame are symbols that seem to shift and change when you look at them directly, and the surface of the gate ripples with images that appear and disappear too quickly to identify. Small crystals embedded in the frame pulse with a soft, violet light."
