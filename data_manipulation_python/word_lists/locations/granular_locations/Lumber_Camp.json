  "name": "Lumber Camp",
  "description": "A temporary lumber camp provides work for loggers and access to valuable timber, but the dangerous work and remote location create isolation and risk. The logging industry can be profitable but environmentally destructive, while the forest surroundings can hide bandits or dangerous wildlife.",
  "category": "Settlement",
  "atmosphere": "Temporary settlement of rough-hewn shelters and hard-working loggers. Air carries fresh pine, sawdust, and surrounding forest earth scent. Axes, saws, and falling trees create industry and destruction rhythm. Remote location creates isolation and self-reliance sense. Dangerous work fosters strong worker camaraderie. Forest surroundings provide resources and potential threats. Temporary nature creates impermanence and frontier spirit."
