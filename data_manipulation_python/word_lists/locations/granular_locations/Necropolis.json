  "name": "Necropolis",
  "description": "A vast city of the dead serves as a burial ground and spiritual center, offering connection to ancestors and the afterlife, but the association with death creates fear and superstition. The sacred nature provides protection and spiritual significance, while the focus on death can attract both mourners and necromancers.",
  "category": "Settlement",
  "atmosphere": "Endless rows of stone monuments and marble mausoleums stretch across ancient cobblestone paths. Carved names and dates mark centuries of the dead while chill winds whisper through weathered stone. The air carries dust, old flowers, and the weight of time. Cypress trees cast long shadows over family crypts."
