  "name": "Swamp",
  "description": "A murky swamp provides natural defense and abundant resources, but the treacherous terrain and disease-carrying insects make it dangerous. The waterlogged ground can hide valuable artifacts, while quicksand and poisonous plants create deadly traps.",

  "atmosphere": "Dripping water and distant animal calls. Air thick with humidity and decaying vegetation scent. Mist creates shifting veils. Unstable ground makes every step a gamble. Dense vegetation creates trapped feeling. Metallic tang of standing water."
