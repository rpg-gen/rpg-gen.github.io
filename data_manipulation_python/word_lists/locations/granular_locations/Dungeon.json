  "name": "Dungeon",
  "description": "A traditional dungeon serves as a prison, torture chamber, or storage facility, with cells, guard rooms, and interrogation areas. The grim atmosphere reflects its dark purpose, while the isolated location makes it perfect for hiding prisoners, secrets, or valuable contraband.",
  "category": "Dungeon",
  "atmosphere": "Dripping water and distant screams echo through corridors. Air thick with despair, old blood, and human suffering scent. Cold iron bars and stone walls create prison designed to break spirits. Skin crawls with weight of countless souls who have suffered here. Taste of fear and hopelessness fills mouth. Oppressive darkness seems to swallow all hope."
