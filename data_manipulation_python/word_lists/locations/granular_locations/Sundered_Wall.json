  "name": "Sundered Wall",
  "description": "A defensive wall that once protected a settlement now lies in broken pieces, creating gaps and potential access points. The construction materials and strategic importance make it valuable for rebuilding or military purposes, while the broken nature creates both opportunities and hazards.",
  "category": "Ruin",
  "atmosphere": "Footsteps echo through gaps that once formed impenetrable barrier. Air carries old mortar, strategic importance, and lost protection dust scent. Broken stone walls lie scattered like bones of fallen guardian. Skin tingles with sense of potential access points and military importance. Taste of strategic value and construction materials fills mouth. Weight of broken protection and strategic value presses down on you."
