  "name": "City Jail",
  "description": "A hub of local governance or public administration; adventurers may seek permits, records, or appeal to authorities.",
  "category": "",
  "atmosphere": "The building has an oppressive, institutional feel with thick stone walls and heavy iron bars. The air carries the scent of unwashed bodies, stale food, and despair. The sound of clanging doors and the moans of prisoners creates an atmosphere of punishment and confinement."
