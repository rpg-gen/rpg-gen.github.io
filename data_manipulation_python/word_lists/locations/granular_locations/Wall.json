  "name": "Wall",
  "description": "A defensive wall provides protection and defines settlement boundaries, offering security and control, but the barrier nature can create both protection and isolation. The defensive focus provides security and strategic advantages, while the physical barrier can create both safety and confinement.",
  "category": "Settlement",
  "atmosphere": "Towering stone blocks rise like impenetrable barrier casting long shadows across ground. Air carries stone dust and old mortar scent. Fingertips trace rough, weathered surfaces that have stood for generations. Guards' footsteps echo from walkway above. Taste of security and confinement mingles in mouth. Weight of protection and isolation presses down like stones themselves."
