  "atmosphere": "Sheep bleat and bells tinkle with pastoral symphony while wood smoke curls from simple chimneys in remote isolation. The air carries the scent of wood smoke, sheep, and the promise of self-sufficient life. Every sound echoes with amplified importance. Your skin feels the simple comforts and the sense of vulnerable peace. The taste of pastoral life and remote isolation fills your mouth."
