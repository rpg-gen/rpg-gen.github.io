  "name": "Woodland",
  "description": "A forest with widely spaced trees and an open canopy allows more light to reach the ground, creating a diverse understory. The open nature makes travel easier than dense forests, while still providing cover and resources.",
  "category": "Natural",
  "atmosphere": "Open forest with widely spaced trees allows sunlight to reach the ground while diverse undergrowth flourishes beneath the partial canopy. Woodpeckers tap and squirrels chatter as fallen logs create natural benches. Pine needles and blooming flowers scent the dappled air."
