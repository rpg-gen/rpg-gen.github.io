  "name": "Strait",
  "description": "A narrow strait between landmasses creates a crucial chokepoint for maritime trade and military control. The strong currents can be dangerous for ships, while the strategic importance makes it a target for pirates and naval battles.",
  "category": "Natural",
  "atmosphere": "Rushing water and seabird calls create maritime symphony. Air carries strong salt water and distant lands scent. Strong currents visible in swirling water and foam. Narrow passage creates natural bottleneck feeling. Strategic importance makes place where history is made. Sea funneled between landmasses creates powerful currents."
