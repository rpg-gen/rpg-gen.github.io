  "name": "Mirror Maze",
  "description": "A labyrinth of mirrors creates infinite reflections and illusions, making navigation extremely difficult and disorienting. The mirror magic and illusion effects can be valuable for research or entertainment, while the disorienting effects and potential for getting lost create constant psychological and physical danger.",
  "category": "Dungeon",
  "atmosphere": "Infinite reflections stretch in every direction making reality itself seem uncertain. Air carries glass, magic, and illusion scent. Skin tingles with presence of mirror magic and disorienting effects. Taste of confusion and psychological danger fills mouth. Weight of infinite reflections and constant disorientation makes head spin."
