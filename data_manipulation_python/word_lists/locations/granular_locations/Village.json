  "name": "Village",
  "description": "A small village provides basic services and community support, with enough people to defend against minor threats. The local craftspeople offer essential goods, while the limited infrastructure makes it dependent on larger settlements for specialized needs.",
  "category": "Settlement",
  "atmosphere": "Thatched cottages cluster around a central square where a stone well serves as the community gathering point. Wood smoke curls from chimneys while the sounds of hammers, looms, and daily conversation fill the air. Fresh bread, livestock, and countryside earth create homey scents. Workshop signs hang outside modest buildings."
