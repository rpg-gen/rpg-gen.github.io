  "description": "A divine pathway connects to the Celestial Planes, providing access to the realm of angels and divine power. The celestial connection provides opportunities for divine magic and spiritual research, while the divine nature and potential celestial threats create constant danger.",
  "category": "Planar",
  "atmosphere": "Celestial harmonies echo in perfect counterpoint, each note resonating with divine authority and angelic grace. The air carries the sacred scent of golden ambrosia and celestial dew, with hints of divine roses and pure starlight. Golden light streams down in visible beams, creating pools of radiance that seem to dance across the marble steps. Ethereal feathers drift like snowflakes of light, while golden bells suspended in mid-air ring with their own celestial rhythm. Your entire being feels weightless and pure, as if every impurity has been burned away by divine fire."
