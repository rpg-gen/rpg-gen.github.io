  "description": "A fortified gatehouse controls access to a settlement, offering security and regulation of traffic, but the checkpoint nature can create delays and tension.

  "category": "Settlement",
  "atmosphere": "Massive stone walls and iron-bound gates loom overhead making you feel small and vulnerable. Air carries metallic weapons and armor mixed with waiting travelers sweat scent. Harsh voices bark orders and questions. Footsteps echo on cold stone as guards' eyes follow every move. Taste of authority and suspicion hangs in air. Weight of scrutiny and potential danger makes skin crawl."
