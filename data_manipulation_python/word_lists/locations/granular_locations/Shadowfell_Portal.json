  "name": "Shadowfell Portal",
  "description": "A dark gateway connects to the Shadowfell, providing access to the realm of shadow and despair. The shadow connection provides opportunities for shadow magic and necromantic research, while the dark nature and potential shadow threats create constant danger.",
  "category": "Planar",
  "atmosphere": "The air around the portal feels heavy and oppressive, as if the darkness itself has weight. You hear the soft sound of weeping and the rustle of wings that seem to come from everywhere and nowhere. The scent of damp earth and something sweetly rotten fills your nostrils. Your skin feels clammy and cold, and a sense of deep melancholy settles over you like a heavy blanket. The portal's frame is carved with faces that seem to watch you with empty eyes, and scattered around the entrance are withered flowers and broken mirrors. The shadows cast by the portal seem to move independently, reaching toward you with grasping fingers."
