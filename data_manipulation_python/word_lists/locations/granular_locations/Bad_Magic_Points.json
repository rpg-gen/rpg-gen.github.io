  "description": "Areas where negative magical energy concentrates create harmful effects and attract malevolent magical creatures. The negative energy creates constant danger, while the dark nature can attract evil spellcasters or create supernatural hazards.",

  "atmosphere": "Negative magical energy pulses like dark heartbeat while malevolent magical creatures lurk in shadowed corners with predatory patience. The air carries visible auras of corruption and decay. Every surface feels the weight of dark energy. Your skin crawls with malevolent energy and the sense of supernatural hazard."
