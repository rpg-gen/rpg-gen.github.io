  "name": "Monastery",
  "description": "A peaceful monastery provides spiritual guidance, education, and sanctuary, but the religious focus can create tension with secular authorities. The scholarly environment offers access to ancient knowledge and skills, while the vows of poverty and obedience create unique social dynamics.",
  "category": "Settlement",
  "atmosphere": "Stone cloisters surround peaceful gardens while monks move silently through candlelit corridors. Chanting voices and turning pages create contemplative sounds. The air carries incense, old parchment, and beeswax. Illuminated manuscripts and religious texts fill the scriptorium."
