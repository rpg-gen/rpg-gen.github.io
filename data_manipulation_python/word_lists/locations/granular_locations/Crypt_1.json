  "name": "Crypt",
  "description": "A burial crypt houses the remains of the wealthy and powerful, often containing valuable grave goods and family secrets. The sacred nature provides protection from grave robbers, while the association with death can attract necromancers or restless spirits seeking revenge.",
  "category": "Dungeon",
  "atmosphere": "Cold stone walls close in around you like tomb's embrace. Air thick with old bones, dust, and death itself scent. Footsteps echo hollowly on ancient stone floors. Taste of decay and ancient secrets fills mouth. Skin crawls with weight of countless dead watching from stone beds. Silence so deep it seems to swallow sound itself."
