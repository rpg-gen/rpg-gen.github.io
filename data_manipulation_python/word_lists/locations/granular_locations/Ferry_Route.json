  "name": "Ferry Route",
  "description": "A designated path for boat transportation across water provides essential access where bridges are impossible. The water-based nature makes it vulnerable to weather and attack, while the controlled crossing allows for toll collection and regulation.",
  "category": "Infrastructure",
  "atmosphere": "Lapping waves echo against wooden docks while boat engines hum across the water's surface. The air carries the salty scent of water, boat tar, and the promise of controlled passage. Every surface feels damp with water-based travel. Your skin feels the wooden dock and the sense of controlled vulnerability. The taste of water-based travel and controlled crossing fills your mouth."
