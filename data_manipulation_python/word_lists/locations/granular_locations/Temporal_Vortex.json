  "name": "Temporal Vortex",
  "description": "A magical anomaly where time flows differently, creating areas of accelerated time, time loops, and temporal distortions. The temporal magic provides opportunities for time-based research and unique experiences, while the unpredictable time effects create constant danger of temporal displacement or aging.",
  "category": "Magical",
  "atmosphere": "The air hums with metallic resonance while temporal rifts flicker like broken mirrors showing different moments. Pocket watches frozen at impossible times and upward-flowing hourglasses litter the ground. Ancient ozone scents mix with echoes of conversations from past and future."
