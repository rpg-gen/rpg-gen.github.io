  "name": "Barbarian Yurt Camp",
  "description": "A mobile settlement of nomadic warriors creates a unique cultural experience and trading opportunity. The traditional knowledge and skills can be valuable to outsiders, while the mobile nature makes it difficult to track or control.",
  "category": "Settlement",
  "atmosphere": "Felt yurts arranged in protective circles house nomadic families while warriors practice with traditional weapons. Communal fires burn yak dung and dried grass as horses graze nearby. The air carries leather, herbs, and wood smoke. Colorful banners and totems mark clan territories."
