  "name": "Haunted Ruins",
  "description": "Abandoned structures inhabited by restless spirits create dangerous environments with potential supernatural rewards. The spiritual energy and potential magical artifacts attract ghost hunters and scholars, while the supernatural inhabitants create constant danger.",
  "category": "Magical",
  "atmosphere": "Ethereal whispers drift through crumbling corridors. The air carries the musty scent of decay mixed with cold spiritual energy. Flickering shadows dance across broken walls without visible source. Protective wards and spirit-trapping devices litter the floor. Your breath comes out as visible mist despite the warmth. A bone-deep chill settles into your core that no fire can warm."
