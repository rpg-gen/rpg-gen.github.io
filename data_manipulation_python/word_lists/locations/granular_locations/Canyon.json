  "name": "Canyon",
  "description": "A deep, narrow canyon with sheer walls creates natural corridors for travel but offers few escape routes. The walls provide excellent ambush points, and flash floods can turn it into a deadly water trap.",
  "category": "Natural",
  "atmosphere": "Footsteps echo eerily off towering walls. Wind whistles through with dry stone scent. Narrow strip of sky feels impossibly distant. Rock walls close in like nature's corridor. Cool, still air amplifies every sound."
