  "name": "Stockades",
  "description": "A fortified site for soldiers and defense; adventurers could obtain contracts, enlist aid, or break in to free captives.",
  "category": "",
  "atmosphere": "The stockades have a grim, punitive atmosphere with the scent of fear and the sound of prisoners being held and the clank of iron restraints.
