  "name": "Island",
  "description": "A single island provides natural isolation and defense, but limited resources and space restrict population growth. The surrounding waters offer fishing and trade routes, while the isolation can preserve unique cultures or hide dangerous secrets.",

  "atmosphere": "World unto itself surrounded by water creating protection and isolation. Natural moat with limited space creating intimacy and self-containment. Isolation preserves unique cultures and secrets. Constant water presence creates maritime atmosphere. Clearly defined boundaries feel like complete, self-contained world. Fresh salt water and island vegetation scent."
