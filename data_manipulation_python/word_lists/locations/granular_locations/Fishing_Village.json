  "name": "Fishing Village",
  "description": "A coastal fishing village provides fresh seafood and maritime skills, but the dependence on the sea makes it vulnerable to storms and piracy. The fishing industry creates a tight-knit community, while the isolated location can hide smuggling operations or secret activities.",
  "category": "Settlement",
  "atmosphere": "Tight-knit community built around sea rhythm. Salty air carries fresh fish, seaweed, and ocean presence scent. Waves, seagulls, and creaking fishing boats create maritime symphony. Dependence on sea creates vulnerability and resilience sense. Fishing industry binds community together with shared purpose and mutual support. Isolated location provides privacy while constant storm and piracy threat creates danger and adventure atmosphere."
