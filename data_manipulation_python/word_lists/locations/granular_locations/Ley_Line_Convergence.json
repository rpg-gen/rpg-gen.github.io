  "atmosphere": "A deep, resonant hum vibrates through your bones, the sound of raw magical energy flowing like invisible rivers beneath your feet. The air crackles with the sharp scent of lightning and the sweet smell of pure mana, mixed with the earthy aroma of ancient stone. Lines of pure energy converge overhead, creating a web of light that pulses and flows like living veins. Crystalline formations grow from every surface, their facets catching and amplifying the magical light. The ground beneath your feet feels warm and alive, pulsing with the rhythm of the ley lines. Your hair stands on end from the static charge, and every movement feels amplified, as if the air itself is charged with potential."
