  "name": "Lighthouse",
  "description": "A coastal lighthouse guides ships safely to port and provides a beacon of hope, but the isolated location makes it vulnerable to storms and attack. The vital role in maritime safety creates respect and responsibility, while the constant exposure to the elements creates unique challenges.",
  "category": "Settlement",
  "atmosphere": "A towering beacon sweeps the coastline while waves crash against rocky foundations. The rhythmic light rotation guides ships through dangerous waters. Salty air carries ocean spray and burning oil from the lamp room. Keeper's quarters nestle below the massive lens apparatus."
