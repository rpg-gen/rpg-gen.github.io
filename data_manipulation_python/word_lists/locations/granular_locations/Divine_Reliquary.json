  "name": "Divine Reliquary",
  "description": "A sacred repository contains the remains or possessions of holy figures, providing spiritual connection and divine power to those who venerate them. The religious significance provides protection and divine favor, while the valuable relics attract both worshippers and those seeking to steal or desecrate them.",
  "category": "Sacred Site",
  "atmosphere": "Whispers of ancient prayers echo off vaulted ceilings with reverent hush. Air carries dust of centuries, old parchment, and faint scent of preserved remains. Golden reliquaries gleam in candlelight with precious jewels and holy symbols. Fingers brush against velvet-lined cases containing bone fragments and sacred garments. Skin crawls with sense of being watched by spirits of holy figures. Weight of sacred history and divine protection makes every step feel like trespassing on hallowed ground."
