  "name": "Farmstead",
  "description": "A small agricultural settlement provides food and basic supplies for the surrounding area. The rural location offers peace and self-sufficiency, while the isolation makes it vulnerable to bandits and natural disasters.",
  "category": "Settlement",
  "atmosphere": "Golden fields of grain surround a modest farmhouse while livestock graze in fenced pastures. Farm animals low and cluck as wind rustles through crops ready for harvest. The air carries rich earth, livestock, and fresh bread scents. A stone well and vegetable garden sit beside weathered barns and silos."
