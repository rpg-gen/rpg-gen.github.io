  "name": "Watchtower",
  "description": "A tall watchtower provides excellent visibility and early warning of approaching threats, but the isolated position makes it vulnerable to attack. The elevated position offers strategic advantages for communication and observation, while the limited space restricts long-term habitation.",
  "category": "Settlement",
  "atmosphere": "A tall stone tower commands sweeping views of the surrounding landscape while signal fires burn at the summit. Wind whistles through arrow slits as guards scan distant horizons. The air carries stone dust and mountain winds. Beacon equipment and message scrolls occupy the upper chambers."
