  "name": "Suspension Bridge",
  "description": "A bridge supported by cables provides crossing over deep valleys or wide rivers where traditional bridges are impossible. The bridge provides essential access across difficult terrain, while the suspended nature and potential structural failure create constant danger.",
  "category": "Infrastructure",
  "atmosphere": "Steel cables support a swaying walkway high above deep chasms while wind whistles through the structure. The bridge flexes with each gust as travelers grip the guide ropes. Metallic creaking and cable tension create constant reminders of the precarious crossing. Far below, valleys or rivers emphasize the dramatic height."
