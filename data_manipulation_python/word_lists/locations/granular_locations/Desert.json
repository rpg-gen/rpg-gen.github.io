  "name": "Desert",
  "description": "A vast desert offers open terrain for fast travel but extreme temperatures and lack of water create deadly challenges. The harsh environment preserves ancient artifacts and creates unique survival scenarios, while sandstorms can bury entire caravans.",
  "category": "Natural",
  "atmosphere": "Stretches to horizon in every direction. Infinite space and isolation. Heat shimmers create dancing horizon illusions. Profound silence broken by wind whisper and distant bird cries. Vast emptiness creates freedom and vulnerability. Bone-dry air scented of hot sand and mirages."
