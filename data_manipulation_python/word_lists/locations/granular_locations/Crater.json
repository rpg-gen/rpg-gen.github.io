  "name": "Crater",
  "description": "A deep crater, whether from meteor impact or volcanic activity, creates a unique microclimate. The bowl shape can trap water or magical energies, while the steep sides make escape difficult if danger approaches.",
  "category": "Natural",
  "atmosphere": "World within world with steep sides blocking wind. Natural prison feeling with bowl shape amplifying sounds strangely. Enclosed space feels protective yet confining. Still, warm air scented of collected water, vegetation, or impact minerals."
