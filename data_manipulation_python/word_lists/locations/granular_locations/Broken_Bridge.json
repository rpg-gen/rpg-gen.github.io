  "name": "Broken Bridge",
  "description": "A collapsed bridge that once connected important locations now creates a barrier and potential hazard. The ruins can provide materials for repair or construction, while the strategic importance of the crossing point makes it valuable for military or trade purposes.",
  "category": "Ruin",
  "atmosphere": "Footsteps echo on broken stone that once carried countless travelers. Air carries old mortar, rushing water, and strategic importance scent. Collapsed stone spans create broken connection across dangerous waters. Skin tingles with sense of potential hazard and valuable materials. Taste of lost connection and strategic value fills mouth. Weight of broken connections and strategic importance presses down on you."
