  "name": "Mangrove Swamp",
  "description": "A tangled mangrove swamp creates a maze of waterways and roots, perfect for hiding or ambushing enemies. The brackish water supports unique wildlife, while the unstable ground and limited visibility make navigation treacherous.",
  "category": "Natural",
  "atmosphere": "Water lapping against twisted roots. Air thick with salt, decay, and mud scent. Tangled roots create natural maze. Brackish water reflects sky in distorted ways. Distant calls of water birds. Unstable ground makes every step uncertain."
