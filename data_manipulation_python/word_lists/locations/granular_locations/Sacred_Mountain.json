  "atmosphere": "Wind howls through jagged peaks with voices of ancient spirits. Thin mountain air carries crisp snow and distant thunder scent. Eagles circle overhead with piercing cries that echo across valleys. Fingers trace weathered prayer flags fluttering in high winds. Skin burns with cold and thin air that makes every breath precious. Weight of altitude and spiritual significance makes heart race with both exhaustion and awe."
