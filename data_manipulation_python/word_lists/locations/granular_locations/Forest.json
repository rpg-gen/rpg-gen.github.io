  "name": "Forest",
  "description": "A dense forest provides abundant resources, cover for stealth, and natural barriers. The thick canopy limits visibility and creates navigation challenges, while the diverse wildlife can be both a food source and a deadly threat.",
  "category": "Natural",
  "atmosphere": "Dappled light and shadow world. Canopy filters sunlight into golden shafts. Rustling branches, bird calls, and wind whisper create natural symphony. Dense vegetation like nature's cathedral. Limited visibility makes sounds seem just beyond sight. Rich air scented of pine, earth, and decay."
