  "description": "A divine portal provides direct connection to the celestial realms, allowing communication and travel between the mortal and divine worlds. The divine nature provides protection and spiritual guidance, while the planar connection attracts both divine messengers and those seeking to exploit the gateway.",
  "category": "Sacred Site",
  "atmosphere": "Celestial music drifts through portal with harmonies impossible in mortal world. Air shimmers with scent of starlight, divine essence, and pure creation energy. Angelic wings rustle and divine light pulses through gateway between worlds. Fingers trace smooth surfaces of portal frame carved with angelic symbols. Skin tingles with sense of being between mortal and divine realms. Weight of planar barrier and celestial energy makes body feel both heavy and weightless simultaneously."
