You immediately sense time and personal identity at a scale beyond your normal understanding. You absorb the simultaneous experiences of others — possibly from billions of beings. Your knowledge quest must be limited to a subject that you could reasonably come to understand by seeing through the eyes of others. For instance, you may set out to learn the true history of a species, identify who and where the most powerful being is, discover the location of a secret object, or become generally accustomed to the beliefs and practices of a culture. You cannot use the spell for things that one mind could not reasonably possess (for instance, by asking for “all the world’s knowledge”). The Guide will decide if your request is reasonable. Beware.
