### **Diamonds** - Signs of Civilization

For turn in which you have a diamond card, roll 2d6. The first die represents the race that created or lives in the location, and the second die represents relative alliance or aggression towards nearby civilizations (closer numbers are friendlier, while more distant numbers are increasingly hostile). For example rolling a "2" and "4" for a civilization roll would mean a dwarven/industrial race, that is super friendly with nearby "4"s, perhaps even allied. A nearby "1" would likely be very aggressive to it, perhaps at war even. A nearby "6" might have a tentative truce and maybe some basic trade going on with it.
