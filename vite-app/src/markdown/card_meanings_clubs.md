### **Clubs** - Rumors and Tales

**A - Ask the Inn Keeper.** You talk with a local innkeeper and swap tales over drinks. Draw an extra card. Resolve that card in any tile(s) on the entire map. Draw enough extra tiles to resolve the card (like if it has you do a diverse biome).

**2 - Survivor's Warning.** You run into someone how tells you about how they barely survived an encounter. Are they a sole survivor? How did they survive? What is the danger they faced? Mark the place anywhere on the map where the danger lies. If your 4th card is a critical failure, end a world project and relate it to the survivor's tale.

**3 - Travelling Bard.** You hear a bard performing a ballad about a notable figure in the world, either alive or dead. 4th card success means a hero. Failure mans a villain. Mark anywhere in the world where that villain lives. Who are they? Why are they famour or notorious? What kind of person are they? What is their home like?

**4 - Lost Manuscript.** You find a lost or ancient manuscript, or read an interesting book. It tells you about an interesting flora or fauna, as well as where to find it. OR, it details a historical event. Or it's a map to hidden trasure. On success, the story is a real history, or you find the item. On failure, the story is fiction or fable, and you aren't able to find the item. Did someone get to it before you?

**5 - Campfire Philosophy.** A stranger or friend who shares your fire for a night talks with you through the night about a religion, philosophy, or belief that exists in the world. What is it? How to others feel about it? How prevelant is it?

**6 - Famous Artifact.** you hear about a signficant item in the world. Is it the sword of a leader? The crown of a lich? A stone that grants wishes? On success you are able to see / touch / interact with some item or otherwise satisfy yourself that it is real. On Failure, you just hear tales and you aren't sure if they are just tall tales.

**7 - Military Patrol.** You are stopped and questioned by a military patrol. What are they patrolling for? Are tensions high between nearby civilzations? Adjust up to three nearby aggression results tied to signs of civilzation to reflect greater or decreased hostility, or shifting alliances.

**8 - Wizard Display.** A travelling wizard, warlock, sorcerer, witch, etc is seen doing some magic. How does the magic work? What kind of system controls its use. On success this is benign or good-seeming magic. On failure, it has an evil tint to it. Critical successes or failures mean powerful magic, while regular success or failures mean lower-level magic.

**9 - Local Guide.** You have a local guide show you around the area. Plus 2 tiles. Name one thing anywhere on the map that isn't already named.

**10 - Traders.** You do an exchange with some traders, and learn about the current state of world commerce. On success, name a material or substance that has a surplus in the world. on failure, name a scarcity. Crits increase the surplus or scarcity level.

**J - End a World Project.** You hear about a world project that ended. Pick from any of the current world projects, or create your own if there aren't any. Use your 4th die to determine how the project ended, and describe how it happened and what the result was.

**Q - Begin a world project.** You hear about a large project being started. Is someone going to war? Is a population migrating? Is a college of wizards trying to create a new spell?

**K - Prophecy.** You encounter a prophet, sage, preacher, or scholar that tells you from firsthand knowledge about an impending event that will affect the whole world. Use your 4th card to determine the magnitude and perception of the event. This prophecy counts as a world project where the outcome is already determined before it ends. However, the effects of that outcome can still be determined as good/bad once it get's resolved.
