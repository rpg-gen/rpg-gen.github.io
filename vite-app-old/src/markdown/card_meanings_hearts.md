### **Hearts** - Map the Geography

**A - .** **Giant Biome.** You encounter a large swathe of land that is all of the same biome. You explore 2 extra tiles this turn, but all your explored tiles must be the same biome.

*Is there a reason for this large area? Is there a story? How does this section of land affect the world around it?*

**2 - Diverse Biomes.** You encounter an unusually diverse series of biomes. Each tile you explore must be a different biome (so six different biomes).

*Why is this area so high in biodiversity? How does it increase interactions between species or civilizations?*

**3 - Mountain Pass.** You encounter a mountain pass of 1d6 length. Whatever you roll, that many of your explored tiles have to have mountains on at least 4 sides of them. If there are unexplored tiles you can draw mountains in them in order to satisfy this. If your 4th card is red, you find a hidden valley. Add an additional tile (your 7th) that is surrounded on all 6 sides by mountain.

*Who uses this pass? Does it connect two regions or lands? Is it dangerous? Is it beautiful? Is it a major defensive area or secret vulnerability?*

**4 - Ocean Crossing.** You attempt an ocean crossing of 1d6 x 3 length. If your 4th card is red you find land at the other end. At some point before your final 6th tile you switch to ocean tiles (which don't count against your 6-tile-total). If your 4th card is black, you don't find land at the end. This means your ocean tiles have to come only after your 6th tile is placed.

*What is the crossing like? Is it beautiful beaches or jagged rocks? Are there storms? Is it peaceful? Can you see the other land from your side?*

**5 - Follow the Beach.** You find a beach and follow along it. Draw 3 extra tiles, but 6 tiles total must be next to ocean. You can draw the ocean tiles to satisfy this if needed.

*Is it sandy, cold, hot, rocky? Is it a place for tourists? For Traders? Is a natural beauty or a inhospitable obstacle?*

**6 - Strange flora or fauna.** 4th card success means friendly or beneficial, 4th card failure means hostile or dangerous. Draw an extra tile where this is discovered.

*What is the creature or plant? How was it found? What does it do? How do the locals treat it?*

**7 - Surrounded biome.** You can draw an extra tile this turn: You encounter a tile that is surrounded on all sides by a single other type type. You can include ocean in this, meaning could essentially create an island or a huge lake.

*What is the significance of the surrounded land. It is avoided, or sought after? Is it valuable or worthless? Is it feared or reverenced?*

**8 - Valuable Natural Resource.** You can draw an extra tile this turn that is the location of a valuable Natural Resource.

*What is the resource? Was it easy or hard to find? Is it something that people will flock to and want to form new settlemnts there for easy access? Will natives be protective against exploitation?*

**9 - Lake or Pool.** You can draw an extra tile. It has to have a lake or pool in it (but not the whole tile).

*What is the significance of this body of water. Is it a murky swamp water or a sparkling majestic pool?*

**10 - Cavern Entrace or Caves.** You find the entrace to a cave, cavern, or network of caves. Draw an additional tile where this is found.

*How large is the cave area? Is it fully explored by you? Are there any mysteries about it? Does it seem stable or fragile?*

**J - High-viz Landmark.** You draw an extra tile that is nearby or touching the path of your travel. This hex contains a highly-visible landmark that you can see from far away. If the landmark is nearby by NOT touching your path, you can mark the landmark but not the biome type.

*Is it a tall mountain? A giant tree? A volcano? A floating island? A strange glow? Whatever it is, you have to be able to see it from far away.*

**Q - Magical Site.** You find a place where the magic of the world naturally flows or collectds. Add an additional tile with the site.

*Is it a magic pool, a fairy field? Is it a large mystical rock in a barren circle that seethes with darkness?*

**K - Float the River.** You find a river and decide to travel along it for 1d6x2 length. These are in addition to your 6 regular tiles, which can be put alongside the river at any point (representing excursions off the river). The river should exit and enter hexes at the mid point of a side, and flow roughly through the center of the hex. You get to decide the biome of each hex the river passes through.

*What size is the river? Is it coming down from a mountain or swirling through the flatlands? How fast is it moving? Are there any rapids? How does it start or end?*
