# Map Gen Rules

## Game Concept

This is a map-creating game designed to be played ideally in a group. The game will still work for solo play, but the experience and end result will be different.

The primary goal of the game is to end up with a dynamically-built world with rich history and lore that can be used to run TTRPGs, write novels, or inspire creators in any other way. The game guides players in turn-based drawing of a hex-based biome map grid along with annotating the significant features, locations, people, artifacts, magic systems, and beliefs that populate the world.

The rules exist only to provide stimulating constraints on creativity, and as such can be adapted or modified to fit whatever type of world you are hoping to generate. For example, horror-based worlds would likely want to modify the list of available biomes and encounters to match their theme.

## Required tools

- At least one six-side die
- Deck of 52 playing cards, plus jokers (optional)
- Something to draw on, digital or physical
- Something to take notes on, digital or physical

## Story Premise

You play as an expedition that is leaving their isolated home community and embarking on a journey in pursuit of a powerful goal that can only be met by venturing out into the wide, unknown, world. Be it one single person or a caravan of hundreds, your expedition is united by your shared passion to achieve the goal and make whatever sacrifices might be required on the way. Your journey may end quickly in ruin, or in unexpected success. Or you may walk the land until the nomadic life becomes all that your people can remember.

However it ends, you expedition will leave a mark in the world. The geography you map will guild future travellers. The tales you collect will be shared around campfires and inns around the land. You will spawn mythology, chronicle epochs, and forge the culture of the world. That ruined castle you passed will someday be explored by a fledling wizard looking for ancient knowledge. The ambitious kingdom you encountered may give rise to an evil world power that needs to be stopped by a brave party of adventures. The cursed goblin scepter you heard rumors of will be sought out by a dwarven rune-smith looking to smelt a new powerful artifact.

## Set the stage

Pick your world's theme. What do you want the major biomes to be? What do you want the major races to be? What historical period do you want it set in?

There are 6 built-in biomes you can use, or you can customize if other biomes better fit your needs. These are meant to be rough guides as to what the land looks like in each hex.

1. Plains / prairie / meadow / fields
2. Mountain / peaks/ crags/ cliffs
3. Hills / foothills / slopes
4. Desert / barren / wasteland / dunes / tundra
5. Jungle / rainforest / forest / grove
6. Bogs / marsh / wetlands / swamp

These don't include ocean tiles, which are handled via the cards you draw.

There are 6 built in "races" you can use, or you can customize if other race categories better fit your needs. These are meant to be rough guides about the type of race related to the points of interest in your world.

1. Human / Agricultural
2. Dwarven / Industrial
3. Elves / Natural
4. Bestial / Nomadic / Hordes / Tribal
5. Smaller-than-human / Insectoid / Miniature
6. Larger-than-human / giant / Colossal / hulking

## Beginning your Story

You start play by deciding on your expedition's demographics and goal. What race are you? How many people are joining the group? Where are you setting out from? Will your group be looking to colonize a new land? Will they be searching for a long-lost heirloom? Will they be travelling the land to find the answer to a philosphical question? Are they looking to flee danger and find a new home? Are they merchants looking for valuable trade goods? Are they hunting a rare beast? Are they seeking revenge for their kings murder? Whatever their goal, it needs to be flexible enough to allow for creating many stories along the way.

**Plan your Journey**

What does final success for your group look like? Before embarking you need to decide what will happen if the fates smile upon you and you progress far enough to achieve your goal? This can adapt over time as you build the story, but you should have at least a general idea. On success, you will get to identify or terraform one hex tile to represent the result or the aftermath of your party's success.

What does final failure look like? This should be anything that could happen that would destroy or disband your group. "Death of all members" is an obvious go-to, but there may be other creative options. Begin thinking about this and make some notes about the options. If your party ends in failure, you will still get to terraform a final hex to represent that outcome.

You may also want to think about what incremental successes and failures will look like for your goal. You will have encounters along the way that will bring unexpected fortune or bitter setbacks. Having some idea of how your goal could be broken down into smaller achievements will help with having a narratively satisfying goal.

**Terraform your starting hex**

Pick a hex on the blank map to be your starting point. Pick the biome, and mark any significant city, point of interest, or any other details that relate to your group or your quest in that starter hex. As part of this you will also need to decide the dimensions of your whole map. How many tiles wide and tall will the boundaries of your world be?

If you have extra six-sided die, get two of them and place the in front of you. One is your progress die, and the second is your milestone die. Set the progress die to 3, and the milestone die to 1. Progress or setbacks will increase or decrease the counter on the intermediate die, while Major failures or successes can increase or decrease the milestone die. If the progress die ticks above 6, increase the milestone die by 1 and reset the progress die back down to 1 and keep counting up from there. The progress die cannot decrease below 1, and thus setbacks cannot directly decrease the milestone die. If your milestone die increases above 6, Congratulations your expedition encounters final success. If somehow your milestone die drops below 1, your expedition ends in final failure. You'll get to resolve your ending either way, and can start a new expedition if there's still more map to reveal.

If you don't have die, you can track this with pen/paper as well.

## Turns

Deal 3 face-up cards and 1 face-down card to each player. Each face-up card represents part of your encounter for that phase of your journey. Use the lookup chart to determine what you find. Each card could be a separate thing, or you can weave them all together into the aspects of a single thing. The face-down card represents either success or failure, and can impact progress towards your expedition's goal. You won't reveal this card until after resolving the other three cards. Instead of mapping this 4th card like the first 3, it will indicate how successful the other three cards were. In general, that 4th card will have these meanings, although not all scenarios use all these options

Red (Diamond) - critical success
Red (Heart) - Success
Black (Clubs) - Failure
Black (Space) - Critical Failure

Regardless of what other card you draw, a success in your 4th card will add a +1 to your progress die. This will add on top of other progress you make, or could lessen a progress loss.

Your expedition can explore by default 6 hexes from its starting hex. Each explored hex has to share a side with the previouly explored hex (no jumping around, etc). The only exception is if there are no available unexplored hexes that you can reach. In that case you can jump over any length of previously-explored hexes to find more blank hexes to explore.

Each hex is as wide as a person could walk in one day over flat terrain.

With each hex you explore, pick one of the 6 biomes and draw it there (or roll the six-sided die if you want it to be random). Unless the cards you drew say otherwise, you get free reign over what biomes you put.

After drawing all the biomes and adding any features that the cards tell you to, flip over the success/failure card.

You can add as much story and exposition as you want. The goal is to create story and meaning behind what you find. Think about why, how, what, when, etc for each significant feature you get to draw. Record this for your world-building dictionary at the end. Some starter questions are included but you should flesh out your details as much as you want or answer other questions about it entirely. Your group can be a good source for questions to answer about your place.

**Terraform your Ending Hex**

Wherever your expedition ends, in success or failure, you'll get to terraform that hex as well, making it whatetever makes sense for your story. Note this can be an already-explored hex. If you still have more map to draw you can start another expedition.
